  <h1>Mastering Remote Work Etiquettes - Navigating Virtual Communication and Collaboration</h1>
  <h1>0-Preamble</h1>
<h1 id="please-dont-just-say-hello-in-chat">Please Don’t Just Say Hello In Chat</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Modern chat communication should be done in a way that saves time for all participants and enables an efficient, asynchronous exchange of information. <strong>Don’t expect an answer if you just write “Hello” in chat</strong>. Don’t call someone out of the blue. Instead, phrase a message that allows your chat partners to provide a meaningful response as soon as they allocate time to read and answer your message.</p>
<h2 id="chat-etiquette">Chat Etiquette</h2>
<pre class="text"><code>2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hello
2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hi.
# CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION
2010-07-19 12:34:01 you: I&#39;m working on [something] and I&#39;m trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that&#39;s [answer...]</code></pre>
<p>It’s as if you called someone on the phone and said “Hello!” and then put them on hold!</p>
<p>Please do this instead:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hello -- I&#39;m working on [something] and I&#39;m trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]</code></pre>
<p>Note that you get help minutes sooner, and you don’t make them wait. Instead, the co-worker can start thinking about your question right away!</p>
<p>You’re trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in person or on the phone. But Chat is neither of those things. Typing is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity.</p>
<p>The same goes for “Hello – Are you there?”, “Hi Bob – quick question.”, “Do you have a sec ?”, “yt?” and “ping”. Just ask the question!</p>
<p>If you feel it’s brusque to simply say “Hi” and ask the question, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- if you&#39;re not busy I was wondering if I could ask a question. I&#39;m working on [something] and I&#39;m trying to do [etc...]</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, asking your question before getting a reply allows asynchronous communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a “Hello” and wondering what they missed.</p>
<h2 id="call-etiquette">Call Etiquette</h2>
<p>Don’t call someone out of the blue. Respect that your desired call partner might be busy and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>. Calling someone means you request immediate, full attention, interrupting any other activity. Some people like to probe with an initial “hello” to verify whether the presence status shown is true, hoping they can determine whether the recipient is near a device, then will immediately follow up with a call. Don’t do that either. If someone is able and willing to answer a chat message, it does not mean that they are also available for a voice or video call.</p>
<p>Instead of sending a call probe, or asking “hey, do you have time for a call?” (which is better but not great), you can try something like this:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>2020-07-08 12:32:12 you: Hi - do you have X min for a quick call to talk about XYZ? [etc...]</code></pre>
<p>This does three things: it time bounds the request, it gives the recipient some context, and it helps you remember what you wanted to talk about if the recipient can’t or doesn’t respond until later.</p>

    <h1>Your guide to chat etiquette in the workplace</h1>
    <p><em>Microsoft 365 Team<br>June 17, 2021</em></p>
    <p>With remote work on the rise, instant messaging in chat-based workspace apps is rapidly becoming the go-to business
        communication method. Instant messaging at work lets you use dynamic tools that can help foster conversation and
        collaboration across teams, projects, and organizations. Whether you work in the same room as your teammates, a
        cubicle away, or across an ocean, maintaining a robust, respectful chat etiquette can help you boost productivity,
        engagement, and connection with colleagues. It even can help improve your wellbeing and mental health.</p>
    <h2>Why professional communication etiquette matters</h2>
    <p>Today’s chat and IM tools offer everything from task management, file sharing, and real-time collaboration to
        private messaging, video conferencing, and online meetings. Unfortunately, this explosion of communication options
        creates the potential for workplace misunderstandings, churn, or worse—including drops in productivity, low
        morale, and business risks. No matter what your role, knowing your company’s chat and online meeting etiquette
        is a must. Efficiently managing your channels, meetings, and instant messaging at work can help you minimize
        distractions and overstimulation while increasing efficiency and job satisfaction. Maintaining a respectful chat
        etiquette also can help foster accessibility, inclusivity, and equity.</p>
    <h2>Instant messaging at work</h2>
    <p>What should you consider before you bring the ping? Here are some best practices for messaging your colleagues on
        a workplace chat platform:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose the right mode. Should you send an email, an IM, or a meeting invite? Choose which to use based on
            workstreams, recipient, and topic. Here are some rules of thumb:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use IM or chat for internal teams and ongoing collaborations, but use email for summarizing projects
                with external working groups or stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Move rapid back-and-forth conversations from email threads to quick IMs. This reduces email clutter and
                spares everyone’s full inboxes (including yours).</li>
            <li>If written IMs prove unclear, offer to jump on a quick voice call. Sometimes this the fastest way to
                resolve an issue and show that you value other people’s time.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Set notifications so that you respond quickly. It’s good chat etiquette to configure your notifications so
            that you see all of your messages and mentions and respond in a timely manner. You can also save, bookmark,
            and pin important chat conversations. If you get overwhelmed by notifications, toggle off all but your
            highest priorities.</li>
        <li>Familiarize yourself with accessibility guidelines. Being inclusive and making sure every voice is heard
            isn’t just good professional communication etiquette, it also helps to nurture collaboration and improve
            your team’s productivity.</li>
        <li>Second that emotion—but with restraint. Many workplace chat apps feature emojis, memes, stickers, and GIFs.
            When it comes to injecting some fun into your digital conversations, a little goes a long way. Try to match
            your emoji, meme, and GIF usage to the rest of your team. You don’t want to be “that” person. 😛</li>
        <li>Use sentiment and reactions appropriately. The thumbs-up button—often thought of as the “like” button—can
            help you close the loop on conversations faster, with less back-and-forth. Use it to convey “understood,”
            “okay,” or “will do.” Use the “love,” “laugh,” “wow,” “cry,” or “mad” sentiments more sparingly, depending
            on your team’s norms.</li>
        <li>Respect your coworkers’ availability status. Never ping a colleague who’s set themselves as unavailable—unless
            they’ve expressly asked you to. And be sure that your own availability status is current so that no one
            messages you during a presentation or when you’re out of the office.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Professional chat etiquette for groups</h2>
    <p>Group IM conversations have their own unique chat etiquette. These quick tips can help you keep your group chats
        efficient and help everyone involved stay on task:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tag (also known as @mention) group members when you need a response. Be aware, though, that tagging is
            commonly associated with a call to action and can seem bossy if not used with discretion. Don’t @mention
            someone unless you really need to.</li>
        <li>Tag new members to welcome them to the group. They’ll get a notification, which will help them return to the
            conversation later. If your platform allows it, share the chat history with new members. It’ll save everyone
            time in getting new members up to speed.</li>
        <li>Keep messages short and concise. Ensure that there’s some value in every chat message you send.</li>
        <li>Acknowledge receipt. Use the thumbs-up or “like” button to let others know that you got or agree with their
            message.</li>
        <li>Remember that tone doesn’t always translate. Do keep your IMs brief, but be careful not to be brusque.</li>
        <li>Avoid repeating yourself. Many chat platforms let you search through conversation histories. Spare your
            colleagues from having to answer the same question twice by searching for an answer first.</li>
        <li>Name your group chat if your platform allows it. Doing so will make it easier for group members to distinguish
            your chat from other threads.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chat etiquette for private chats</h2>
    <p>Sending IMs to your colleagues can help you stay agile, especially when it comes to high-priority projects. Doing
        so also helps to create a virtual water cooler that enhances camaraderie.</p>
    <p>A few professional communication etiquette tips to keep in mind for private chats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use them for brainstorming, private asides, and impromptu follow-ups. But when a private conversation starts
            getting into larger team decisions, it’s time to carry it over to a group chat or an email thread.</li>
        <li>Nix the greetings. No need to start a chat with “Hi, how are you?”, “Quick question,” or “Do you have a
            second?” While it may seem abrupt to simply lead with your question, it’s actually a courtesy that lets your
            colleague reply on their own terms.</li>
        <li>Have fun and be social! Private chats are a great place to let your personality and shine and make meaningful
            connections with your close colleagues. So unleash the GIFs, release

 the puppy pics, and share that recipe
            for perfect pizza crust.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Online meeting etiquette</h2>
    <p>Online meetings have become the new normal for businesses, regardless of industry. Here are some tips for video
        conferencing and online meeting etiquette:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always join on mute. Be aware of camera and microphone settings before you enter a meeting. Don’t be the
            person that everyone can hear chewing their lunch.</li>
        <li>Use video when possible. Yes, video uses extra internet resources, but it can give you a more satisfying
            experience and help you and your colleagues feel more connected in meetings.</li>
        <li>Limit visual distractions. Sit in front of a neutral wall, curtain, or bookshelf. Use virtual backgrounds
            judiciously, too, as they can be jarring if they’re too busy or render poorly.</li>
        <li>Use the chat feature to ask questions and share resources. Typing your questions or suggestions in the chat
            helps reduce crosstalk and other disruptions. It also saves resources in the chat history for later
            reference.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to visibility when sharing your screen. Familiarize yourself with how to maximize your screen
            and zoom in on images so that everyone can see what you’re sharing.</li>
    </ul>
